Hello my name is Aarnav. I've always wanted to learn about computer science but never really got a chance untill now. In this blog I will walk through the steps I used to set up my tools and create this blog.

**Step 1**

The first step was creating a Github account. Github is a platform used for software development that stores code inside a repository. Github is great because it allows team members to collaborate on projects effecitvely.

**Step 2**

The second step was to create a repository in Github. A repository is important because it stores files and keeps track of changes. A repository is like the home base of a project. To create our repository we used a student template on github.

**Step 3**

Next we learned how to commit through VScode. We changed our name on the page and commited the change which saves the code. Commits are important because it keeps your work organized and also allows you to rewind if something goes wrong down the line.

**Step 4**

After using the browser version of VScode we installed the app which allows everything to run much faster. For Macos we installed Homebrew which is a package manager on mac. Homebrew makes it much easier to set up tools and keeps everything up to date.

**Step 5**

The fifth step of our process was to create a usable workspace on our computer. We ran commands in terminal which created an opencs folder and then cloned a github repository and activated the venv which is a virtual environment.

**Step 6** 

Next we did an extremely similar proccess be navigating to our directory and cloning another repository, this time by using our personal github username. We activated the venv again and then launched the project in VScode.

**Step 7**

The seventh step was to open a terminal in VScode and run the command, "make". This command runs everthing in the makefile which starts the server and creates a local host. The local host is like a test server where we can visualize our changes.
