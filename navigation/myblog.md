Hello my name is Aarnav. I've always wanted to learn about computer science but never really got a chance untill now. In this blog I will walk through the steps I used to set up my tools and create this blog.

**Step 1**

The first step was creating a Github account. Github is a platform used for software development that stores code inside a repository. Github is great because it allows team members to collaborate on projects effecitvely.

The second step was to create a repository in Github. A repository is important because it stores files and keeps track of changes. A repository is like the home base of a project. To create our repository we used a student template on github.

Next we learned how to commit through VScode. We changed our name on the page and commited the change which saves the code. Commits are important because it keeps your work organized and also allows you to rewind if something goes wrong down the line.

After using the browser version of VScode we installed the app which allows everything to run much faster. For Macos we installed homebrew which is a package manager on mac.
